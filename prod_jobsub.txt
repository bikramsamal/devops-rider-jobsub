Drop the index and continue with upgrade (known issue).
drop index saturn.SMTCRSE_INDEX1;



General 8.13 --> Make sure that all the following are down :
Gurjobs, sleepwake, shradvq, sfradvq,Finaid queues, clean address.
WHen running the final gurutlrp process, it took forever and found that degreeworks process was blocking , hence had to kill that process. It is better that all apps are shutdown for this upgrade.
